# RAG_Agent using Langchain

This repository demonstrates a flexible question answering agent built with LangChain. The project processes PDF documents, builds vector stores, and uses retrieval-based QA to answer user queries. It is designed to work with Groq and OpenAI modelsâ€”and can be easily adapted to use open source language models.
